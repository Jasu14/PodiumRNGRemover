## How to set it up

Download the newest Release from the "Releases" Section up top.

Place the PodiumRNGRemover.dll in your LiveSplit/Components folder.

Add this to LiveSplit by going into your Layout Editor -> Add -> Control -> PodiumRNGRemover.

You can then configure your hotkeys within the component settings in the Layout Settings.

If you set it up correctly, you can assign the keys for each podium type (Good, Medium, Bad, and Reset) in the component settings.

Make sure that LiveSplit is running and the timer is active when you want to use the hotkeys during your speedrun.

The default hotkeys are:
- Key 1: Good Podium (0s deduction)
- Key 2: Medium Podium (-2.3s deduction)
- Key 3: Bad Podium (-3.3s deduction)
- Key 0: Reset current split deduction

You can change these keys in the component settings by clicking on the key fields and pressing the desired key.

The component will automatically adjust your game time when you press the corresponding key during a podium sequence and go to the next split.
